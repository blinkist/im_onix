## Pragmatic ONIX 3.0 parser for Ruby

### Low level API
Whole structure is accessible through ONIX::ONIXMessage object :
```ruby
message=ONIX::ONIXMessage.new
message.parse("onix_file.xml")
# first product
pp message.products.first
# first identifier of first product
pp message.products.first.identifiers.first
```

Ruby elements variables are underscored, lowercase of ONIX tags (Product -> product, DescriptiveDetail -> descriptive_detail) and pluralized in case of array (ProductSupply -> product_supplies).

### High level API
High level methods give abstracted and simplified access to the most important data.
See http://nu.immateriel.fr/im_onix/doc/ONIX/Product.html for high level API rdoc and onix_pp.rb, onix3_to_onix2.rb and onix3_to_onix3.rb sample in bin/

Usage :
```shell
onix_pp.rb onix.xml
onix3_to_onix2.rb onix.xml
onix3_to_onix3.rb onix.xml
```
